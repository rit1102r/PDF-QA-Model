Indeed, insurance ser\\xad\\nvices represent 0.76 percent of total services and 0.46 percent of the gross \\ndomestic product of the Canadian economy. \\nThe frrst purpose of this monograph is to analyze the structure of the in\\xad\\nsurance industry, the role of insurers as financial intermediaries, the \\ndemand for insurance, and the production of insurance services. The \\nsecond purpose is to draw out the relevant policy conclusions from the \\nanalysis. The focus of government policy for the insurance industry has \\ncentered on competition, regulation and taxation. \\nThe insurance industry includes life (individual and group life and an\\xad\\nnuities and pension fund management), accident and sickness (health care, \\ndental care, and disability) and property and casualty (vehicles, real proper\\xad\\nty and liability). In terms of premiums, in 1985 the private sector com\\xad\\nponents of the industry were: life insurance 49.1 percent, accident and \\nsickness 8.8 percent and property and casualty 42.1 percent. Over the \\nperiod 1961-85, insurance firms have experienced average annual (output) \\ngrowth rates of 4.4 percent which has equaled the rate for the economy as a \\nwhole and has surpassed the growth rate of 4.1 percent for manufacturing. \\nHowever, the components of the industry have grown at substantially dif\\xad\\nferent rates. Life insurers have had an average annual growth rate of 5.8 \\npercent, while property and casualty insurers have only grown by 2.8 per\\xad\\ncent annually. \\nPrices of insurance policies like prices of other commodities have risen \\nover the last two and a half decades. In comparison with the CPI which has \\ngrown annually by 8.2 percent between 1971 and 1985, the prices of tenant \\nand homeowner insurance have grown annually by 12.3 percent and 13.1 \\npercent respectively. Although the inflation rates of these two policies has \\nbeen one and half times faster than the CPI, the price of life insurance \\npolicies has grown annually about half as fast as the CPI, while the price \\nfor auto insurance policies has increased in line with the CPI. \\nThe Canadian insurance industry is not concentrated in the hands of a \\nfew firms. Entry is relatively easy. Inaeed, in 1985 the percentage of net \\npremiums written by the largest four firms writing property and casualty \\npolicies was 18.1 percent In the life insurance segment, the degree of con-\\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

In fact in 1985 there were \\n167 life insurance fmos ope rating in Can�. \\nPurchasers of insurance policies buy financial protection from insurance \\nfmos because these companies have created the facilities to pool risks. \\nThus, insurance fmos actl1ally provide a·form of financial intermediation, \\nand indeed engage in a wide variety of other intermediary roles. Relative \\nto total fmancial assets, the size of life insurance firms' financial assets has \\nbeen falling over the post World War Two period. In particular, the \\nindustry's holdings of mortgage assets has declined since the 1960s, when \\nabout 30 percent of all mortgages in Canada were held by the industry, to \\nabout 13 percent in recent years. A change in NHA mortgages from a 25 to \\na 5-year term has been the chief cause of this shift in the mortgage market. \\nGovernment tax policy has had significant effects on the demand for life \\ninsurance and on the product mix. Policies which have encouraged savings \\nthrough tax sheltered RRSPs have increased demand for annuities both by \\nindividuals who initially register their RRSPs with a life company, and by \\nthose who purchase a life annuity upon maturity of an RRSP originally \\nregistered with another financial institution. \\nApart from changes in product demand caused by tax changes, there has \\nbeen a pronounced cUstomer shift away from whole life policies and \\ntoward term insurance. This shift has resulted in smaller amounts of funds \\nunder the control of life companies and has been the single most important \\nfactor explaining the secular decline in the relative size of insurance com\\xad\\npany financial assets. \\nDirect regulation of the industry has been aimed at influencing the \\nportfolio demand of insurers. Regulation of asset structures has been \\ndesigned to protect policy holders. However, there is little evidence that \\nthis regulation has in practice influenced companies' portfolio decisions. \\nHouseholds purchase over half of all insurance services. About 5 per\\xad\\ncent goes to exports and the bulk of the remainder is purchased as inter\\xad\\nmediate inputs by industry, chiefly fmance insurance and real estate. \\nBoth cross-section al (Le., across demanders) and time-series analyses \\nshow the demand for insurance services to respond to income changes. In\\xad\\ndeed, in the cross-section context a 1 percent increase in income causes the \\ndemand for insurance to increase by 1.25 percent. The percentage change \\nis somewhat greater over time. The income effect implies, in the absence \\nof insurance price changes relative to the CPI, that the secular growth rate \\nof insurance is higher than the growth rate of income, but also that in\\xad\\nsurance demand is subject to wider fluctuations over the business cycle \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

Income changes affect insurance services, and indeed \\nservices in general, relatively more than the demands for non-durables, \\nsemi-durables and durable commo dities. \\nPrice changes also affect the demand for insurance services. A I percent \\nincrease in the price of insurance services causes the demand to fall by 1.3 \\npercent. This estimate implies that a policy of increasing prices cause \\nrevenues from sales to decline, given that income and other demographic \\neffects are·not changing. As for income, price changes affect.the demand \\nfor all services including insurance relatively more than the demand for \\nother types of commodities. \\nThe production of insurance· services does not constitute a natural \\nmonopoly. Economies of scale (or specialization) and economies of scope \\n(or diversity) are not pervasive in the industry. Thus the industry is charac\\xad\\nterized by a large number of fmns with significant diversity of sizes. There \\nare no significant entry barr iers and prices appear to be equal to average \\ncost so that there is little if any supra-competitive profit However, there \\nare substantial differences in prices among insurers for similar policies. \\nThese price differences may exist because there are significant product \\nquality differences such as differences in claims handling and in part be\\xad\\ncause of the costly acquisition of price information by consumers. \\nThe issue of scale economies is relevant to horizontal merger policy. \\nHorizontal mergers in the presence of scale economies can reduce unit \\ncosts and thereby prices and also increase efficiency within the industry. \\nHowever, there is no strong evidence of scale economies in the industry. \\nThe existence of scope economies plays an important role in the deter\\xad\\nmination of the efficiency consequences of conglomerate mergers. These \\nmergers are relevant to entry deregulation of the four pillars; insurance \\nfmns, chartered banks, security dealers and trust companies. The existence \\nof significant economies of scope implies that there could be efficiency \\ngains from mergers across fmns in these different markets. Yet, evidence \\non scope economies is extremely scarce and what evidence there is con\\xad\\ncludes that economies are rather weak for the insurance industry. \\nLabour productivity in the life insurance industry grew at an average an\\xad\\nnual rate of 3.95 percent which exceeded the annual growth rate in \\nmanufacturing of 3.08 percent and for the economy as a whole of 2.77 per\\xad\\ncent. However, labour productivity in the property and casualty industry \\nwas virtually stagnant over the 1975 to 1985 decade. In addition, over the \\ntime period 1978 to 1985 total factor productivity for the insurance in\\xad\\ndustry, as a whole, grew at a 1.00 percent average annual rate, which com\\xad\\npares favorably with estimates for total manufacturing. \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='xvi Pref ace and Summa ry \\nInsurance fmns have been reactive rather than innovative in designing \\nnew products. This stance has contributed to the decline in assets of the in\\xad\\ndustry relative to other financial institutions. However the pace of product \\ninnovation has increased over-the last decade. \\nCanadian life insurers have been successful in extending their operation \\nto other countries. Indeed, in 1985 40 percent of global premium income of \\ncompanies operating in Canada was earned from foreign operations. Rela\\xad\\ntive to the total value of insurance services produced in Canada, exports \\nand imports are in the range of 5 percent to 7 percent, with exports roughly \\n90 percent of imports. Canada, along with most foreign countries, requires \\nthat domestic assets of insurance companies be held against domestic \\nliabilities. The objective of this regulation has been prudential, aimed at en\\xad\\nsuring financial health of the industry and fmancial safety for \\npolicyholders. But the regulation is also protectionist and serves to reduce \\ninternational trade in insurance services. \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=\"Chapter 1 \\nIntroduction and Overview \\nNearly everyone buys insurance. If you have a mortgage on your house, the \\nmortgage company requires you to buy a homeowner's policy. You cannot \\nobtain a licence plate for your car without insurance. Your employer may pay \\nfor part or all of the expense of group life and extended health care or dental \\ncare insurance plans. Your pension plan may be managed by a life insurance \\ncompany. If you contribute to an RRSP, you must collapse it, buy, an RRIF \\nor buy an annuity from a life insurance company before age 71. \\nDespite the ubiquity of insurance, the nature of the product and the in\\xad\\ndustry are little understood by the average person. An insurance policy is a \\ncomplex financial instrument (a contingent claim, in economic jargon) \\nwhich pays the policyholder prescribed sums contingent upon the occurrence \\nof certain insured events (i.e., under prescribed states of nature). \\nPolicyholders demand insurance to reduce the variability of their wealth or \\ntheir survivors' wealth. The purpose of this study is to explain the charac\\xad\\nteristics and importance of the industry in the economy, describe its products \\nand discuss the policy issues affecting the industry. \\nThis monograph contains considerable descriptive material but also a \\nnumber of original contributions. The cross-section and time series analyses \\nof consumer demand for insurance in chapter 3 have not been presented \\nbefore, and the measures of real output and productivity in chapter 4 are new. \\nWe give arguments for a number of changes in Statistics Canada's \\nmethodologies. In particular, new estimates of real output for life and proper\\xad\\nty/casualty are presented. We advocate a new imputation for the interest for\\xad\\ngone on property/casualty policyholders' advances to insurers (chapter 4). \\nThe consumer price index currently contains no measure for life insurance \\nservices; we propose ope in chapter 2. \\nThe scope of this monograph encompasses insurance carriers for the \\nperiod 1961-85. Both the time period and the industry defmition are deter\\xad\\nmined, in part, by data availability. Statistics Canada's input/output tables \\nand Financial Flow Accounts go back to 1961.

Most property/casualty insurance is sold through independent \\nagents, while most life insurance is sold by agents Statistics Canada classifies \\nas company employees. \\nThere are two classes of insurance carriers as defined by the products they \\nsell. Life insurance carriers sell life insurance and annuities, manage pension \\nfunds and sell health insurance (also called accident and sickness insurance). \\nProperty/casualty insurers (also called general insurers or property/liability \\nor fife and casualty insurers) offer a wide range of products from insurance \\non real estate, autos, airplanes and ships, to credit insurance and insurance \\nagainst court judgments for liability. \\nChapter 2 begins with a description (supported by statistical data) of the \\nworld insurance market, the structure of the Canadian industry, its size and \\ngrowth, employment and wages, and its price performance, including a new \\nmeasure of price for life insurance services. This material provides a neces\\xad\\nsary preliminary perspective and foundation for the analyses in following \\nchapters. \\nChapter 3 focuses on the demand for insurance, starting with an account\\xad\\ning of the sources of supply and demand by sector (demand by business, \\ngovernment and households, plus exports) and moving to a detailed analysis \\nof household demand. Here we present original work using cross-section and \\ntime series data. We found that the demand for insurance responds strongly \\nand positively to changes in income (the effect is higher for life insurance, \\nmuch lower for property/casualty insurance). As a result, the secular growth \\nis at a higher rate than is the rate for income growth. Demand also respOnds \\nstrongly and negatively to price increases, implying that price increases \\nreduce sales revenues. Demographic variables (age and sex of household \\nhead, size of household, geographic location, homeowner versus tenant), \\nwhich also have a strong influence on demand are analysed in chapter 3 as \\nwell. These demand analyses help explain the growth performance of the in\\xad\\ndustry. \\nChapter 4 analyses the production technology of the industry and presents \\nnew measures of real output and productivity. Our results show quite high \\ngrowth in labour productivity for life insurance but a flat trend in output per \\nemployee in property/casualty. Total factor productivity also shows respect\\xad\\nable growth but has fluctuated over the period 1961-85. In addition, this \\nchapter analyses the evidence for and significance of returns to scale (or \\neconomies of specialization) and economies of scope (or returns to product \\ndiversity) in insurance. Returns to scale help explain industry structure.

Changes in product mix and the decline of the industry's mainstay, the \\nwhole life policy, provide the main explanation. The significance of the in\\xad\\nsurance industry in markets for specific financial instruments is also ex\\xad\\namined. Life insurers ceased to be the major participant in residential \\nmortgage markets during the period covered by our analysis, largely as a \\nresult of changes in the characteristics of the mortgage instrument.

Comparisons among total economy, total manufacturing, total \\nfinance insurance and real estate (FIRE), and insurance industry data are \\nmade where relevant. \\nA GLOBAL PERSPE CTIVE ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY \\nThe \"GNP elasticity of demand\" for insurance, i.e., the ratio of the \\npercentage increase in national expenditure on insurance to the percentage \\nincrease in gross national product per capita, is greater than one. This is \\nequivalent to the observation that the share of insurance in GNP increases as \\nGNP per capita rises (see Wasow 1986:173). At lower income levels, this \\nelasticity is higher than at higher levels of GNP per capita (Baker 1987: 196). \\nThe more wealthy countries spend a larger fraction of income on insurance, \\nand they control a larger share of world incomes. The U.S. and other \\ndeveloped countries overwhelmingly dominate the world market (see table \\n1). Canada ranks fifth among all countries in total life insurance premiums \\nand sixth in non-life; but when measured in proportion to GNP, Canada \\nranked second only to Japan in 1985 in life insurance (Canadian Life and \\nHealth Insurance Association Facts, hereinafter referred to as CLHIA \\nFacts). \\nA number of trends have significantly changed the world market since the \\nSecond World War. The share of the North American market has fallen from \\nabout 75 percent in the early 1950s to 54 percent in 1984.

First, we \\npresent an analysis in the form of an overview of the demand for insurance \\nin Canada, distinguishing between final demand by households and govern\\xad\\nment versus intermediate demand by various industries. We also analyse the \\navailable export and import data, explaining the conventions of balance of \\npayments estimates which underlie the data. Secondly, we provide a theoreti\\xad\\ncal framework which shows that consumer demand for insurance can be \\ntreated in a parallel manner to demand for any other commodity. Thirdly, we \\npresent some original results from an analysis of the 1982 Family Expe ndi\\xad\\nture Survey data on household purchases of insurance services. Lastly, we \\npresent an original analysis of aggregate time series data on consumer \\ndemand for insurance services in the context of a complete model of demand \\nbehaviour. \\nINDUSTRIAL DEMAND FOR INSURANCE SERVICES \\nStatistics Canada's input/output tables provide an ideal framework for an \\noverview of insurance commodity supply and demand. In the Canadian sys\\xad\\ntem, input/output tables are rectangular (commodity-by-industry) matrices \\nshowing production of commodities by industries and use of commodities as \\ninputs in the production process (intermediate demand) or as deliveries to \\nfmal demand (consumption, government purchases, capital investment; and \\nexports). Each industry can produce more than one commodity, and each \\ncommodity can be produced by more than one industry. \\nThere is only one insurance commodity (number 556) in the input/output \\nsystem and only one business sector industry which produces it. The com\\xad\\nmodity is insurance services and encompasses life insurance, proper\\xad\\nty/liability and health insurance (including the health insurance services of \\nprivate companies but not those health insurance services provided by \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

Hence, WCB is part of the \\ninsurance commodity but is nol produced by the insurance industry. The in\\xad\\nsurance activities of government business enterprises (PGICs) which are the \\nInsurance Corporation of B.C., Saskatchewan Government Insurance Cor\\xad\\nporation and the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation (but not the Regie \\nde l' assurance autorrwbile du Quebec) are included in the business sector, \\nnot in general government. \\nMore than 90 percent of the insurance commodity is provided by the \\ndomestic business sector (insurance carriers, industry 169); imports provide \\nmost of the remainder and the rest, a small proportion in the form of produc\\xad\\ntion by general government of insurance services (WCB), is valued at cost. \\nSee table 8 for the breakdown of supply which shows a trend over the period \\n1961-84 of a rising proportion of imports and of government sector produc\\xad\\ntion. \\nWithin the Canadian system of national accounts, life insurance services \\nare valued in terms of the operating costs of producing them. Proper\\xad\\nty/casualty insurance services are valued as the difference between net \\npremiums earned and net claims paid. (See chapter 4 for a detailed analysis \\nof the important question of measuring output.) Investment income is ex\\xad\\ncluded from output of property/casualty insurance, so this component of the \\nindustry usually has negative profits. In our opinion, this way of measuring \\noutput is faulty. We mention it here to remind the reader that the data \\npresented in table 8 under-represent the value of the insurance commodity by \\nabout 10 percent and slightly overstate the variability of production over \\ntime. \\nTable 8 provides a breakdown of demand as well as supply. An almost \\nsteady 50 percent is purchased by consumers who purchase all life insurance. \\nGovernment takes less than 1 percent, and exports have absorbed a propor\\xad\\ntion which has almost doubled from 2.78 percent in 1961 to 5.37 percent in \\n1984. The ratio of exports to imports has fallen since 1966. \\nIntermediate demand is broken down in table 8 by industry group. The \\n[mance, insurance and real estate industry includes real estate rental, the cor\\xad\\nporate owners of residential and commercial property. It is not surprising to \\nsee that this is the largest source of demand. \\nThe relative decline in insurance demand by the primary sector (agricul\\xad\\nture, forestry, fishing, trapping, mining, quarrying and oil wells) is at\\xad\\ntributable to the relative decline in the size of this sector. Similarly, we see \\nthe effects of the decline in manufacturing activity since 1976. Total inter\\xad\\nmediate demand fell from 1961 to 1966 but remained stable after that. \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 33}),\n",

A23/B23 comprises transac\\xad\\ntions by governments not included elsewhere in the accounts, miscellaneous \\nincome, and business services and other transactions. The latter two contain \\nelements of trade in insurance services. The net revenues of Canadian in\\xad\\nsurance companies from insurance operations abroad and the corresponding \\npayment item are in miscellaneous income. These item s have a large (but in\\xad\\ndete rmina ble) element of payment to head office for management, account\\xad\\ning, and other servic es; so, despite the fact that the remaining part of net \\nrevenues are factor payments, these items are class ified as .services. Part of \\nthe net revenue of Canadian head offices from operat ions abroad is branch \\nprofits earned abroad (bran ches are not incorporated as foreign subsidiaries \\nabroad) . These are recorde d on an accrual , not a payments , basis ; this con\\xad\\nstitutes an exception to standard practice in the BOP. \\nThe bulk of insurance transactions are property/c asualty and marine \\nprem iums net of claim s, classified to business services and other transac\\xad\\ntions. Much of these insurance premiums are earned on goods shipped \\nabroad and, correspondi ngly, on imported goods which are insured in transit. \\nAdditional transactions are related to re-insurance, with major international \\nre-insurers being located abroad. \\nCanadian life insuran ce companies, in their global operat ions, earned \\nabout $5.6 billion or 40 percent of their premium income abroad in 1985 \\n(CLHIA Facts) . These figures do not appear in the Canadian BOP except as \\ndescribed above, because the premiums are largely earned by subsidiaries \\nabroad and as such are transactions between a non-resident institution and \\nnon-resident individual s. The great success of Canadian life companies \\nabroad is little reflected in the balance of payments . \\nThe BOP presentation of insurance transactions is not completely consis\\xad\\ntent with the rest of the Canadian System of National Accounts (CSNA) . In \\nthe rest of the CSNA, lif e insurance is valued in terms of the associated \\noperating expenses , not as prem iums less claims. The reserves of both lif e \\ncompanies and property/c asualty companies are treated as assets of \\npolicyholders in the CSNA.

The data re\\xad\\nquirements may be forbidding, but it would seem appropriate to render BOP \\ntreatment consistent with the rest of the CSNA. Finally, we note that our \\nproposal to include imputed interest in the value of proper ty/c asualty in\\xad\\nsurance premium s (as discussed in chapter 4) should be carried over to the \\nBOP. \\nCONSUMERS ' INSURANC E DE CISIONS \\nIndividuals face risks which can lead to loss of proper ty, loss of ability to \\nearn income and, in the extr eme, loss of life. It is possible for an individual \\nto insure against these events, at least to a certain extent. An insurance firm \\npools the risks of individuals and thereby is able to offer contingent claims \\nor policies against various losses . \\nThe decision to purchase insurance is like any consump tion/portfolio \\ndecision (see Ehrlich and Becker 1972). The variety and quantity of in\\xad\\nsurance purchased reflects the consume r's prefe rence s, expectati ons, in\\xad\\ncome, the prices of insurance policies and the prices of other commodities. A \\nsimple model will serve to highlight the insurance deci'sion. Suppose an in\\xad\\ndividual purchases two commodities, insurance and non -insu rance or con\\xad\\nsumption. The quantity of the latter is Xl and for simplicity the price is always \\nnormalized to $1. The nominal or dollar value of insurance is repre sented by \\nz. The individual also has nominal income, y. Insurance is purchased in order \\nto protect against loss of family income. In this example, the insurance policy \\nis related to disability or loss of life. If the individual lives or is not disabled \\n(i.e., state of nature I) the family budget constraint is \\n(I) Xl + Z= Y \\nHowever, if the individual suffers a loss of income (i.e., state of nature 2) \\nthen the budget constraint is \\n(2) X2+ z = bz \\nwhere X2 is the quantity of consumption when loss of income occurs (there is \\nno reason for Xl = X2), b > 1 is the benefits received per dollar of insurance. \\nThe budget constraints can be pictured quite easily if we combine the two \\nequations by solving for z in (2) and then substitute into (1). Thus \\n(3) Xl + X2/ (b-I) = y \\nIfX2 = 0, then Xl = y. All the. income is devoted to consumption when no \\ndisa bility or loss of life occurs. Ifxl = 0, then X2 = y(b- I). Recall that if Xl \\n= 0, then z = y. So all income is spent on insurance and X2 = z(b- I) with \\nz(b- I) defmed as the net income to be devoted to consumption when \\ndisability or loss of life occurs. \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 36}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='20 Demandf or Insurance Services \\nFor given income (y) and per dollar insurance benefi ts (b), when Xl in\\xad\\ncreases by one unit then X2 must decrease by (b-l). This can be seen from \\nequation 3. For a given level of income, any increase in consumption in the \\nfirst state of nature (Xl) in which no loss is suffered means a sacrifice of (b-\\n1) units of consumption in the second state of nature (X2) in which the loss is \\nsuffered. Geometricall y, in figure 1, y is repre sented by point A, y(b-l) is \\ngiven by point B. \\nEquations 1 and 2 or just 3 represent the constraints under which an in\\xad\\ndividual has to make decisions. In order to make decisions , however, an in\\xad\\ndividual must have an objective. The objective represents the prefere nces or \\ntastes of the individual, and it can be written down as \\n(4) u = qU(XI) + (1-q)U(X2) \\nwhere U is the preference or utility function which shows how an individual \\nvalues consumption and U is increasing in Xl and X2, q is the proba bility-that \\nthere will not be any disability or loss of life, so (I-q) is the probabi lity that \\nthe individual will suffer a loss of income, and u represents the expected \\nutility of consumption under the two possible events. An individual decides \\n. how much to consum e and purchases insurance by maximizing expected \\nutility, subject to the constra ints. \\nIt is possible to trace the trade-off between Xl and X2 according to the \\nindividual \\'s preference in the same manner that we performed this task for \\nthe constraint faced by the individual . If expected utility (u) and probab ility \\n(q) are fixed, then an increase in Xl leads to an increase in utility (U) by \\nqU\\'(XI). The\\' denotes the marginal or incremental increase in U due to an in\\xad\\ncrease in Xl. In order to keep expected utility fixed, X2 must decreas e. This \\ndecrease causes utility to decline by (1-q)U\\'(X2) . Thus the trade-off OfX2 for \\nXl isqU\\'(X I) / (1-q)U\\'(X2) . The curve in figure 1 shows the prefe rences of the \\nindividual, and the slope of the curve denotes the trade-off between con\\xad\\nsumption with and without the loss in income according to these prefer ences. \\nIn order to obtain the highest level of prefere nce satisfac tion possible \\ngiven the budget constrain ts, the individual equates the preference trade-off \\nbetween X2 and Xl to the market trade -off given by the budget constraints. \\nThis means that the individual is willing to give up the same amount of Xl for \\nan additional unit of X2 as the market dictates. Hence, the condition is \\nqU\\' (Xl) \\n(5) (I-q)U\\'(X2) = (b-l) \\nGeometrica lly, point E in figure 1 shows the quantities of Xl\\'\" and X2\\'\" \\ndemanded by the individual .

In this secti on, we exploit disaggregated data, but for \\nour purposes the available data are limited in significant respects. Respon\\xad\\ndents to the family expenditure survey are asked to report expend iture on the \\nfollowing categories of insurance: homeowne r's insurance, tenant's in\\xad\\nsuran ce, life insurance, health insuran ce, and automobile insurance. \\nUnfor tunat ely, the important category of auto insurance is not separately \\nrecorded on the public use data tape. It is also important to note that employer \\npayments for life and health insurance are excluded. So, for example, \\nemployer contributions to group life and extended health care insurance \\nplans are not reported ; on the other hand, employee contributions to the \\ngovernment health care plan in Ontario are reported as part of consumer ex\\xad\\npenditure ' whereas in some other provinces health care is funded entirely \\nfrom tax reve nues. Owing to these limitation s, we conf me our analysis to the \\nfirst three categori es: homeowne r's, tenan t's, and life insurance. \\nThe family expenditure data on insurance record prem ium payments , \\nwhereas the national accounts data on personal consumer expenditure record \\neither the sales and administrative expenses (in the case of life insurance) or \\nthe net of prem iums less claims (in the case of property and casualty in\\xad\\nsurance) . The administrative expenses of government health insurance plans \\nare recorded in government expenditure in the national accounts, not in per\\xad\\nsonal consumption expenditure. As a result of these differen ces, the family \\nexpenditure and the national accounts data used in the time series demand \\nanalysis are not directly comparab le. \\nTable 9 shows the percentage of households reporting expenditure on \\ntenant, homeowner and life insurance and average dollar expenditure in \\n1982. Nearly all homeowners (94.5 percent) purchase insurance on their \\nproperty , and the average annual premium for those who do was $240.05 in \\n1982. By contrast,less than half of all tenants (48.6 perc ent) buy insurance. \\nInsurance on rental property is purchased by the landlord, not the tenan t. \\nTenant insurance covers contents, theft and liability. In view of the more \\nlimited cove rage of tenant's insurance, it is surprising that the average \\npremium, at $232.42, is nearly as high as for homeowne r's policies. This is \\nlikely because only high income tenants buy insurance whereas nearly all \\nhomeowners do. \\nOne possible explanation for the very high incidence of purchase of in\\xad\\nsurance by homeowne rs is that insurance is required by mortgage companies . \\nThis argument is undermined by the observation that nearly half (47.5 per\\xad\\ncent) of homeowners report no mortgage. Homeowners purchase insurance \\nto protect their assets, namely their homes, whether or not these assets are \\nowned in part by mortgage companies. Tenants are in a different position \\nwith respect to protec ting the buildings they occupy. \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",

However, the analysis to this point neglects \\nthe effects of demogra phic variables. One would like to know how expendi\\xad\\nture varies across households which differ in characteri stics such as \\nhousehold size, age of household head, region, urban versus rural, sex of \\nhousehold head, tenure. We next tum to this analysis. \\nOur sample size is sufficiently large at 10,938 that it is feasible to estimate \\nEngel functions, with many dummy variables representing demographic \\ncharacter istics, in the following form: \\n(7) w = a + bIn y + CIOI + c2J)2+ ... CnDn \\nwhere w, a, b, In y are defined as in equation 6 with the subscript i, which \\nrefers to the expenditure category , suppressed; Cj and OJ (j=1 to n) are regres\\xad\\nsion coefficients and dummy variables , respectively. Each dummy variable \\ntakes on the value 1 when a household displays the relevant characte ristic (OJ \\n= 0 otherwis e). The coefficient Cj therefore measures the way that expendi\\xad\\nture shares vary across demographic groups. We note that this functional \\nform has the advantage of permitting exact aggregation in the pooling of \\ncross-sectional and time series data (see Jorgenson, Lau and Stoker 1982), a \\ntopic beyond the scope of this monograph but noted here as a justification for \\nthe functional form in (7). Table 11 shows the results of estimating Engel \\nfunctions of the form in (7) and def mes the dummy variables that were used. \\nIn each of the regressions reported in table 11 (all services, property in\\xad\\nsurance, life insurance) the reference demographic group is a 25-34 year old \\nmale-headed household, with two persons living in a metropolitan area \\n(population greater than 30,0(0) in Ontario and owning their own home. Set\\xad\\nting all dummy variables in the equation equal to zero will yield the relation\\xad\\nship between expenditure share and income for the reference demographic \\ngroup.

In deciding on \\ntheir commodity demands, individuals maximize the objective of preference \\nsatisfaction subject to their budget constraints. The latter is defmed by the \\nprices of commodities and level of income. Numerous models of consumer \\ndemand have been developed in the literature (see Phlips 1983 and Deaton \\nand Muellbauer 1983). Recent work has emphasized that consumer or \\nhousehold demand decisions should be modelled as an interrelated system of \\nequa tions which is sufficiently flexible so as not to rule out empirically sig\\xad\\nnificant effects of price and income changes. In this section we estimate a \\nsystem of consumer demand equations (based on a translog arithmic expen\\xad\\nditure function). This model is also referred to as the almost ideal demand \\nsystem (see Deaton and Muellbauer 1980).

A total of 130 component price \\nseries are aggregated into Divisia price indexes and constant dollar quantities \\nfor these five categories. The sample period is 1952-82. \\nThe categorization of the 130 component series is the same as Statistics \\nCanada \\'s gross national expenditure (GNE) categories for personal con\\xad\\nsumption expenditure, with the following major exceptio ns. Both cash and \\nimputed rent are included in our estimates of consumption of dura bles, \\nwhereas they are included in expenditure on services in the GNE accounts . \\nAll repair services are included in our category of non-insurance serv ices , \\nwhereas in the GNE accounts repair services for durable goods are included \\nin the durables category and repair services for semi -durable goods are in\\xad\\ncluded in semi-dura bles. Finally, a few items (tableware, kitchenware , \\nhardware , lamps, fixtures) which are included in the semi- durab les category \\nin the GNE accounts are classif ied as durables in our data in order to be con\\xad\\nsistent with the Financial Flow Accounts estimates of the stocks of consumer \\ndurab les. \\nThe rental value of each subcategory of durab les is defined to be equal to \\nthe deprec iation plus the opportunity cost of funds invest ed in the stock, \\ndefined as the rate of interest times the value of the stock. Depreciation and \\nstock estimates were provided by the Financial Flows Section. \\nInsurance services comprise expenditures on the following GNE \\ncategor ies: property insuran ce, theft insuran ce, accident and sickness in\\xad\\nsuran ce, auto insurance, and life insurance. Consistent with national \\naccounts \\' conventions, non-lif e insurance expenditures are defmed as \\nprem iums net of claim s; life insu rance expenditures are defined as the com\\xad\\nmissions and general expenses of providing life insurance. \\nThe estimation results are presented in table 12. The fit was good and the \\nmajority of p arameter estimates were statistically significant. Table 13 shows \\nthe effect of a 1 percent increase in income on the demands for non-dura bles, \\nsemi-d urabl es, dura bles, non-in surance services and insurance servi ces. We \\nfmd that services respond relatively more to income changes than do the \\nother commodity groups. Moreover, within serv ices, insurance exhibits a \\nlarger income effect than non-insurance services. Indeed, the demand for in\\xad\\nsuran ce is the most elastic compared to other dema nds. A 1 percent increase \\nin income causes the demand for insurance to increase by 1.5 percent on \\naverage over the period 1952 to 1982. This figure is in line with the income \\neffects obtained in the cross-section ana lysis. \\nBecause prices change over time for each commodity group, and since the \\ndemand for each comm odity is a function of its own price and the price of the \\nother comm oditie s, time series data within the context of our model permits \\nus to investigate the various \"own\" and \"cross\" price effects.

Hence, we find that as commodities are less durable they \\nbecome more price responsive. \\nBesides responding to their own prices, each of the demands also responds \\nto the prices of the other commodities. These effects are the so-called cross \\nprice effects. The importance of these measures is that they show the degree \\nto which commodities are substitutes or compl ements.

The cross price effects \\n(more precisely the partial substitution elasticities of compensated demand) \\nare presented in table 15.

The cross-sectional data reveal a higher income elasticity \\nfor life insurance than property insurance, with the latter less than one, at \\n0.89. Separate data on auto insurance is unavailabl e. Demand for property in\\xad\\nsurance rises with age of household head while demand for life insurance \\nfalls. The reverse pattern holds for size of household, with demand for \\nproperty insurance falling with size of household and demand for life in\\xad\\nsurance rising. Female household heads spend more on property insurance \\nand less on life insuran ce than males.

In particular, we want to focus on the measurement issues \\nrelating to outputs and inputs and the estimates · pertaining to scale \\neconomi es, scope econo mies , factor substitution and productiVity growth. \\nThere are also significant policy concerns which arise from an analysis of \\nthe \"supply side. \" These concerns centre on the efficienc y implications of \\nmergers within the insurance industry and between insurance firms and fInns \\nin other industries in the fmancial sector. For example, a solution to the \\npotential problem of excess concentration in fmancial markets would entail \\na proh ibition against offering many diff erent services in the fmancial sector. \\nHowever, it is also asserted that there are incentives through economies of \\nscope (or diversity) to become a financial conglomerate. The empirical \\nevidence of scope economies highlights whether there are cost incentives to \\nconglomeration or whether the conglomerates may be a vehicle for collusion \\nand therefore monopolization. \\nOUTPUT MEASUREME NT \\nA great deal of controvers y and confusion surrounds the nature of the outputs \\nprovided by insurance fInns. Individu als, or in general any purchasers of in\\xad\\nsurance, actually buy financial prot ection. An insurance firm is able to offer \\nprotection because it has created the facilities for pooling risks . Insurance \\nfirms do not bear the risk of their purchasers ; they pool the risk. Thus, in\\xad\\nsurance companies actually provide fInancial intennediat ion. It is the range \\nof activities an insurance company undertakes as part of its efforts to pool \\nrisks that constitutes the services provided by the company. \\nTo understand more clearly what we mean, consider for example a \\nbrokerage firm dealing in corporate bon ds. Because of various infonnation \\nasymmetries and economies of specializati on, corpora tions sell their bonds \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 52}),\n",

Individuals (or any other type of purchaser) buy the bonds \\nfrom the broker, not directly from the issuer. Let's assume the broker buys \\none kind of bond at $98 each and sells it for $100. What is the output of the \\nbroker and the price of that output? The broker provides the facilities to buy \\nand sell bonds, an intermediary function. The revenue from the intermediary \\nrole is ($100 -$98)n, where n is the number of bonds sold. Hence, $2 n is the \\nrevenue which must cover (in the long run) the current and capital costs of \\nthe brokerage function. In this example, it is relatively easy to determine the \\nrevenues and costs of bond brokerag e. \\nOur example fits neatly into the context of insurance, $100 is the \\npremium, $98 is the claim and n is the number of term life insurance con\\xad\\ntracts (there is assumed to be, for the moment, only one kind of policy). Thus \\n$2 n is the revenue from risk pooling. This concept of revenues related to the \\nintermediation roles of insurance has not often been used in empirical studies \\nof insuran ce, but Geehan (1977), Hirshhom and Geehan (1977), and Kellner \\nand Mathewson (1983) are notable except ions. \\nThe decomposition of insurance revenues into price and quantity com\\xad\\nponents is quite difficult. For example, with revenues of $2 n is the price $2 \\nand the quantity of insurance services equal to the number of contracts (n), \\nor is the price $100 and the quantity (n/50) or is some other combination \\nrelevant? This is an important issue because output quantity figures are \\nneeded to investigate the properties of the produ ction of insurance services \\nsuch as economies of scale and scope and total factor prod uctivity growth. \\nInsurance firms are financial intermediaries whose outputs are contingent \\nclaims. That is, the claim is paid contingent upon the occurrence of the in\\xad\\nsured event or events . These contingent claims represent the financial protec\\xad\\ntion through risk pooling provided to individu als. There are many \\ncharacteristics associated with the contingent claims as each contract can \\nrepresent a different contingent claim . In the insurance industry the latter is \\nreferred to as a policy. \\nThere are four basic characte ristics of an insurance policy. The fIrst \\ncharacteristic represents the insured event, which for example can relate to \\nlife, prope rty, health or unemployment. Second is the surrender value which \\nrelates to the amount available in cash upon voluntary termination of a policy \\nbefore it becomes payable by death or maturity . The surrender value distin\\xad\\nguishes term from basic insuranc e-for the former there is no surrender \\nvalue. The third characteristic is the face value of the policy. This pertains to \\nthe value received by the insured if the event that is being insured against oc\\xad\\ncurs. The last basic characteristic pertains to the policyholder, either an in\\xad\\ndividual or group and the group can consist of various numbers of \\nindividual s. There are many other characte ristics or riders of an insurance \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",

Another rider is the disability waiver \\nwhich is a benefit such that if the insurer is unable to pay the premium due to \\na disability , then the insurance firm will waive the prem ium while keeping \\nthe policy in force. \\nThe outputs of the insurance firm are characterized by the number of \\npolicies classified according to the various characte ristics or riders . Each \\nbundle of character istics represents a policy and the number of policies with \\nidentical characteristics represents the quantity of a particular output of the \\ninsurance firm. Returning to our simple example where n is the number of \\ncontracts of the single type of policy, n is the output quantity since n repre\\xad\\nsents the number of contingent claims for a particular policy, and $2 is the \\nprice. \\nStandard Industrial Classification \\nUnder the standard industrial classification (SIC), insurance output is more \\nor less categorized by the insured event so that within major group 73, which \\nis insurance industries, there are the subgroups life insurers (731), deposit in\\xad\\nsurers (732), and property and casualty insurers (733). As part of the contin\\xad\\ngent claims offered by insurance firms, individuals are able to accumul ate \\nfmancial assets. This fact is reflected in life insurance policies and annuities \\nwhich are classified within group 731. However , there are policies which are \\nnot subject to the investment restrictions on the insurer s' portfoliO set out in \\nthe insurance act. These policies are classified in the group called segregated \\nfunds, which is SIC 7213. Segregated funds are in the group of portf olio in\\xad\\ntermediaries which is 721 and the latter is in major group 72, which is invest\\xad\\nment intermediary industries. \\nIn this study we consider the groups 7311, life insurers; 7331, health in\\xad\\nsurers (we do not include government health insurance); 7339, other proper\\xad\\nty and casualty insurers (we do not include unemployment insurance and \\nworkmen's compensation); and the last group is 7213, segregated funds. The \\noutputs of insurance firms are usually aggregated into two groups, life in\\xad\\nsurance (7311 and 7213) and property and casualty insurance (7331 and \\n7339). \\nLife Insurance Output \\nLife insurance output can be further classified according to the other basic \\ncharact eristics: surrender value, face value and policy holders (individual \\nversus group) .

In general, in terms of the services \\nprovided by the industry, renewals constitute a distinct product. A distinction \\nis also made between term and basic ordinary insurance. This separation is \\nimportant because term and temporary insurance have been increasing much \\nfaster than basic insurance over the last two and a half decades. \\nWhile table 16 reflects the multipl icity of services produced by life in\\xad\\nsurance firms, there has still been an aggregation of services into \"product \\nlines.\" Each of these product lines, however, is dermed by policies which \\nhave common characteristics. Aggregation is inevitable in any empirical \\nanalysis because of the practical difficulty of taking explicit account of the \\nentire spectrum of policies as separate outputs. Issues of aggrega tion, \\nhowever, are quite distinct from the characterization of the outputs in the in\\xad\\nsurance industry. \\nOutput aggrega tion is also necessary when productivity growth (whether \\npartial or total) in the industry is to be measured. To aggregate the various \\noutputs into a single index, their prices and quantities are needed. Quantities \\nare the number of contracts or constant dolla rs in each of the categories in \\ntable 16, while instead of prices, unit costs are used as the weights to form \\nthe aggregate output index. Under the assumptions of constant returns to \\nscale and output price-taking behaviour on the part of the insurance fIrms \\n(i.e., the insurance industry is purely competitive with respect to each of its \\nproducts), product prices are equated to marginal costs which, in tum, are \\nequated to average or unit costs. Hence, under these assumptions it is ap\\xad\\npropriate to use unit costs as the weights in forming an aggregate output \\nindex. Indeed, profIts do not account for more than 2 percent of operating ex\\xad\\npenses over the period 1961 to 1985. \\nUnit costs used as weights in the aggr egate output index are presented in \\ntable 16. The unit costs were derived from the formula used by the Canadian \\nInstitute of Actuaries (1971). A Laspeyres quantity index of output was then \\ncomputed. The index is presented in table 17. The aggregation of output by \\nusing 17 different output categories captures, to a certain extent, the intro\\xad\\nduction of new products (i.e., new policies) and the changing signifIcance in \\nterms of revenue generation of existing products. For example, we have tried \\nto capture the growth in importance of variable policies by treating \\n\"segregated funds\" as a distinct category. However, given the data, it is im\\xad\\npossible to consider all the changes which have taken place in the insurance \\nindustry\\'s outputs. For exa mple, there are no data which could allow us to ac\\xad\\ncount for new intermediation services which are ancillary to life insurance, \\nsuch as estate planning and tax advice.

              " Document(page_content='44 Production and Cost of Insurance Services \\nBefore completing this section on output measurement, we should explain \\nin more detail the reasons behind the imputation of inter est in the determina\\xad\\ntion of the aggregate output index in property !casualty insurance. We argued \\nthat premiums minus claims (net of any re-insu rance) is the appropriate \\nmeasure of revenues for insurance ftrms since it reflects the earnings from \\nrisk poo ling or providing contingent clai ms. However, the bulk (about 60 \\npercent) of investment earnings for property/ casualty fIrm S are derived from \\nfunds which are, in effect, loaned by policyholders. These funds appear as \\nliabilities on the balance sheet and are recorded under \"unearned premiums,\" \\n\"pro vision for unpaid claims,\" and \"other policy reserv es.\" No explicit inter\\xad\\nest is paid on the liabilities. For examp le, the provision for unpaid claims \\nrem ains a liability for the period between the time the claim is first incurred \\nand the time it is paid. In addition, premiums are paid in advance of or at the \\nbeginning of the period covered by a policy. If the period of the policy is one \\nyear, after four months one-third of the premium is taken into revenue as \\nearned, the other two-thirds remains as the liability \"unearned premiums.\" \\nThus, property/ casualty fIrm S are able to offer contingent claims or policies \\nat a lower premium because premiums are paid in advance of claims and in \\nadvance of the time period to be covered by the poli cy, and these funds earn \\na pOsitive rate of return. This return must be added to the premiums minus \\nclaims magnitude in order to obtain the total revenue attributable to proper\\xad\\nty/casualty insurance provision. \\nAt the present time in the Canadian system of national accounts and in the \\nUnited Nations system of national accounts , revenue attributable to proper\\xad\\nty!casualty insurance is computed as premiums minus claim s. Thus, when all \\ncosts of insurance provision are subtracted from revenues the so-called un\\xad\\nderwri ting gain is usually negative. Our proposal parallels the argu ment for \\nimputed intere st in the banking industry. After adding the interest imputa\\xad\\ntion , property/c asualty insurance would be treated in the way which is con\\xad\\nceptually correct and simi lar to ban ks. The underwriting gain, which includes \\nimputed interest, now becomes positive for 24 of the past 25 years . \\nINPUT MEASUREMENT \\nThe major inputs used to provide insurance services are labour, materials and \\ncapital .

Economies of scope exist if the cost of \\nproducing many products together (e.g., in one plant) is less than the cost of \\nproducing the products separately (e.g., in different plants). Economies of \\nscope are clearly illustrated by railroads producing both passenger and \\nfreight services using the same rail bed. As another example, taxi firms clear\\xad\\nly enjoy economies of scope in the provision of two products-trips to the \\nairport, trips from the airport-yet many cities allow all firms to sell the first \\nproduct but bar some firms from selling both services. In life insurance, \\neconomies of scope may result from the cost savings associated with the \\nsales efforts of an agent who can provide a variety of term, whole life and an\\xad\\nnuity policies. Economies of scope may result from joint production of \\nprope rty!liability and life insurance products, or from joint production of in\\xad\\nsurance, deposit, and securities brokerage services. \\nIf costs grow in a greater (lesser) proportion to output growth, there are \\nscale economies (diseconomies). These phenomena are also referred to as in\\xad\\ncreasing and decreasing returns to scale. If costs and output grow at the same \\nrate, returns to scale are constant. Most studies have defined output in terms \\nof premiums or claims. We have argued that this definition is incorre ct, not \\njust because of aggregation problems arising from product heterog eneity and \\nprice different ials, but rather because of the characteristics supplied by in\\xad\\nsurance firms which relate to contingent claims. Premiums (whether or not \\nthey are deflated) do not capture the risk pooling nature of insurance.

Geehan (1977) has shown that there is an upward bias in estimates of \\nscale economies when premiums are the output indicators. \\nTwo different model structures have been used to attempt to avoid the \\nlimitations of prem iums as an output measure . The ftrst approach is to es\\xad\\ntimate separate cost functions for diff erent output categories with premiums \\nfor the specific output class used as the indicator (see Halpern and Mathe\\xad\\nwson 1975). The second appr oach is to introduce additional variables which \\nreflect product heterogeneity such as the ratio of group life to total life, \\naverage policy size, and surrender ratio , to name just a few of the variables \\n(see Praetz 1980). These two approaches attempt to deal with the aggregation \\nproblem associated with the multiplicity of outputs but do not solve the in\\xad\\nherent problems of using premiums as the output variable. In these stud ies, \\ncosts are deftned to include commissions, wages and salari es, rent, deprecia\\xad\\ntion, materi als, purchased services and supplies. \\nThe studies summarized in table 21 provide evidence on the existence of \\nscale economies . A number of conclusions emerge from the results in table \\n21. First, there is virtually no evidence of diseconomies of scale. Secondly, \\nthere may be economies of scale, but these economies are found for relative\\xad\\nly small output quantities. Thus, firm s in the U.S ., Canada, U.K. and \\nAustralia generally produce where returns to scale are constant. Some studies \\nwhich do find rather large scale economies for wide output ranges may have \\nbiased estimates because of their inappropriate output measures. The third \\nresult is that there is a high degree of residual variation in the average cost \\nacross firms which is not accounted for by product mix and output. This may \\nbe the result of limited information on the part of consumers which permits \\nhigh unit cost and thereby allows high price ftrms to survive along with low \\nprice ftrms. \\nThere is only one study which has looked at the evidence regarding \\neconomies of scope or product diversity. Kellner and Mathewsoy (1983) in\\xad\\nvestigate scale and scope economies for the Canadian life insurance industry. \\nThe outputs were measured as the number of contracts in force. Four outputs \\nwere distinguished: individual ordinary life insurance polici es, group lif e in\\xad\\nsurance policies, individual ordinary annuitie s, and group annuities . \\nRevenues were also measured as premiums minus claims minus re-in\\xad\\nsurance. Kellner and Mathewson estimated that for the years 1961, 1966 and \\n1971 scale economies could be rejected but there was some slight evidence \\nof scale economies in 1976. For the four years the scale elasticities were .98, \\n.83, .83, and 1.09. \\nWith respect to scope economies, there was evidence of their existence for \\nthe years 1961, 1966 and 19,71 between ordinary life (both individual and \\ngroup) and annuity outputs.

The inputs were estimated to be \\nsubstitutes for each other, an increase in the price of one input caused an in\\xad\\ncrease in the demand for the other factors. Hence, as factor prices increased, \\ninsurance firms substituted the relatively cheaper inputs into the production \\nprocess. These cross price effects were quite small.

These \\nproductivity growth rates exceeded the rate of 0.95 percent which was es\\xad\\ntimated for Canadian manufacturing over the period 1946-76 (see May and \\nDenny 1979). \\nThe sources of productivity growth in the Canadian life insurance industry \\nare dominated by technological change and unexplained residual effects due \\nto the possibility of lags in the adjustment of labour and capital in the produc\\xad\\ntion process and product demand shifts. Over the period 1962 to 1977, tech\\xad\\nnological change accounted for around 65 percent of productivity growth. \\nWeiss (1986) measured productivity growth for the U.S. life insurance in\\xad\\ndustry.

Indeed, over the whole period productivity \\ngrowth in lif e insurance exceeded the rate for property/c asualty . From 1967 \\nto 1973, output growth for property/c asualty was on average only 3.65 per\\xad\\ncent per year (see table 18). Since labour and material/c apital inputs for both \\ntypes of insurance grew at roughly the same rates, the relatively poor output \\nperf ormance of property/c asualty insurance was due to the low growth in \\nprod uctivity. \\nClearly, there is a need for much more evidence on . the structure of \\nprod uction for life and property/ casualty insurance services. Indeed, other \\nthan estimating measures of scale economies (although incorrect output \\nmeasures were generally used) little has been done, and there is virtually no \\nevidence on the issues of scope economies and productivity growth. \\nCONCLUSIONS \\nAlthough more research is needed regarding the structure of produc tion of \\ninsurance services, some tentative policy conclusions can be draw n. First, it \\nappears that the provision of life insurance does not constitute a natural \\nmonopoly . There do not seem to be significant scale econo mies , nor do scope \\neconomies appear to be pervasive in the industry. Secondly, there is evide nce \\nthat any scale economies in life and property/ casualty insurance exist for \\nonly very small levels of output. Thus, the industry is characterized by a large \\nnumber of fIrms with a significant diversity of sizes. \\nThe third conclusion is that entry is relatively easy or costless in the in\\xad\\nsurance industry. There are no entry barriers , and prices appear to equal \\naverage costs so there is little, if any, monopoly profIt. However, there are \\nsubstantial diff erences in prices among insurance fIrms for similar policies . \\nTo the extent that this diversity exists, it may be the result of greater varia\\xad\\ntion in product quality or greater informational asymmetries on the part of \\nconsumers than has hitherto been empirically investigated. \\nFinally , we note that productivity growth in the life insurance industry has \\nbeen strong and indeed above that for manuf acturing industries. On the other \\nhand, productivity has been virtually flat for the property/ casualty industry. \\nThis result implies that technological change has been more important in life \\ninsurance production compared to the provision of property/ casualty in\\xad\\nsuranc e. \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 73}),\n",

Chapter 5 \\nInsurance Companies As Financial Intermediaries \\nLIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES \\nLife insuranc e companies obtain funds through the sale, usually on an instal\\xad\\nment basis, of contingent claims to annuitants and poli cyholders. The timing \\nand amo unt of payment on these claims is contingent on the events (dea th, \\ndisability, number of years of survival of a pension benefic iary) which form \\nthe conditions of the contract The value of these claims is recorded as \\nreserve liabilities of the insuran ce comp anies and, in the Finan cial Flow Ac\\xad\\ncounts of the Canadian System of National Acc ounts, as assets of persons. \\nThe gross inflows of fund s from insuranc e premiums, annuity consi dera\\xad\\ntions (payments made to purc hase annuities) and investment income less \\ngross outflows of claims, annuity benefit s and operat ing expenses equals the \\nnet internally generated source of funds. These internal ly generated funds are \\nused to lend to other sectors of the economy via the acquisition of finan cial \\nassets. In this way, part of life insuranc e premiums constitut e personal \\nsavings and are channelled by life companies to help fman ce real capital for\\xad\\nmation. Since debt is a negligible item on the balan ce sheet of the industry, \\nborrowing is not a signi ficant source of funds to the industry, nor is debt \\nretirement a signifi cant use of fund s. \\nIn 1985, about 35 percent of gross inflows of funds were from annuity \\nconsi derations, about 25 percent from life insu ranc e premiums and 40 per\\xad\\ncent from investment income . In tum, about 12.5 perc ent of this gross inflow \\nwas used to pay operating expenses and taxes, 44 percent was paid out in cur\\xad\\nrent claims and bene fits, 0.2 percent to shareholders and the remaining 43.3 \\nperc ent was used to acqui re assets.

              " Document(page_content='58 Insurance Companies as Financial Intermediaries \\nFactors Affecting the Flow of Funds \\nA larger fraction of a dollar of whole life insurance prem iums (compared to \\nterm premiums) is retai ned for the acquisition of assets because whole life, \\nespecially in the policy\\'s early years, contains a significant savings com\\xad\\nponent. Similarly, a dollar of deferred annuity premiums goes almost entire\\xad\\nly to acquire assets which may be held for many years before liquidatio n, but \\na single premium annuity pays benefits immediately, leaving a somewhat \\nsmaller fraction to be invested for payment of future benefits. In this way, the \\nproduct mix of the industry influences its growth as a financial intermediary. \\nNo aggregate data exist to show precisely the net internally generated flow \\nof funds by product line, but we do know that both whole life and annuities \\ngenerate more than term or group life per dollar of prem iums. Hence, a num\\xad\\nber of general trends can usefully be analysed as factors contributing to the \\ngrowth rate of the industry as a fmancial institu tion. \\nIndividual insurance prem iums (whole life and term) constitute a decreas\\xad\\ning fraction of total premium and annuity income of the industry, falling from \\nnearly 70 percent in 1961 to less than 30 percent in 1985. Furthermore, in\\xad\\ndividual term insurance has risen relative to individual whole life at the same \\ntime as group (term) insurance has risen relative to individual insurance. \\nSince we have incomplete data on premium income of individual term in\\xad\\nsuran ce-term insurance is often sold in combination with whole life but \\npublished data refer to pure term contracts only-the relative growth of the \\nthree components of life insurance is measured as face amounts (gross sales) . \\nIndividual whole life insurance in 1961 constituted over 40 percent of the \\ntotal of individual whole life plus individual term plus group life, whereas by \\n1985 this proportion had fallen to less than 33 perc ent. In the most recent five \\nyears or so, the trend toward a decreasing share of sales for individual whole \\nlife has been reversed as a result of the pOpularity of new products. In par\\xad\\nticular, these are \"new money policies ,\" in which the premiums are revised \\nperiodically to reflect current and expected interest rates, and \"universal life\" \\npolicies , in which premiums (less expense charges) are credited to a policy \\naccount from which periodic charges for life insurance coverage are \\ndeducted and to which interest is credited. Usua lly, the policyholder can vary \\nthe amount and timing of premium payments and change the amount of in\\xad\\nsuran ce. In effect, with a universal life policy, one has the flexibility of \\n\"buying term and investing the rest,\" with the investment remaining in the \\ncompa ny. The introduction of universal life policies created a virtual revolu\\xad\\ntion in the U.S. in the late \\'70s and in the \\'80s. They have proven to be less \\npopular in Canada, but by 1985 they constituted 12 percent of the face value \\nof all individual life insurance purchases.

These trends were \\nmoderated and perhaps reversed in the '80s. The long-term trend had been \\nunfavourable to the growth of life company assets . \\nAnnuities \\nRelative to all types of life insurance, annuities have grown very rapidly, \\nespe cially duri ng the '70s. Individual annuity income grew from about 5 per\\xad\\ncent of total insurance premiums and annuity considerations to ·10 percent in \\n1971 to a peak of 35 percent in 198 1 and levelled off to 30 percent in 1985. \\nGroup annuity considerations (life company managed pension funds) fluc \\xad\\ntuated only moderately thro ughout the '60s in a range of 16 to 21 percent of \\ntotal life prem ium plus annuity income, then climbed in the '70s and '80s to \\nreach 30 percent in 1985. \\nThe growth of individual annuities is a story worth recounting as it il\\xad\\nlusp'ates the impact of tax rules on product growth . In 1957, regist ered retire\\xad\\nment saviDgs plans (RRSPs) were introduced under federal government \\nlegislation. They permitted individuals to defer taxes on part of their income, \\nnamely on contributions to and investment earnings within an RRSP. The \\ncontributions and the compounded investment income earned on accumu\\xad\\nlated contribution s remain untaxed until the RRSP is colla psed, perhaps as \\nlate as age 71. The rules governing RRSPs were made more flexible and the \\nmaximum contribution s were increased over the years, with major changes \\nin 1972 and 1975, while at the same time effective average marginal tax rates \\nrose, making RRSPs more attrac tive. \\nFrom 1957 to 1972 new registrations grew slowly, and the life insurance \\nindust ry's share increased from 24 percent in 1957 to over 50 percent by \\n1970. After this, new registrations grew explosively from 186, 000 in 1971 to \\nover 2 million in 1985. However, the share of life companies fell to 15 per\\xad\\ncent by 1985, as new competito rs, chiefly the chartered ban ks, took over the \\nmarket. By 1985, chartered ban ks' share had increased to rival that of the \\ntraditional leader, namely trust and mortgage loan companies. \\nBoth annuities and life insurance policies can be registered , but most life \\ncompa nies' RRSPs are individual annuities. In addition to RRSP annuities, \\nlife companies benefitted during the 1970s from tax rules permitting non\\xad\\nregistered income avera ging annuities. In the 1981 budget, income averag ing \\nannuities were eliminated and increased taxes were imposed on non-\\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 76}),\n",

These measures were a substantial blow to the growth \\nof individual annuities. \\nRRSPs were an obvious benefit to the growth of the life insurance in\\xad\\ndustry, but their growth has also had less obvious effects. RRSPs are a sub\\xad\\nstitute , however imperf ect, for the savings component of life insurance \\npolicies because acquisition of the latter is partly motivated by the desire to \\nprovide for retirement years . If life companies had captured most of the \\nRRSP money, they would have suffered no loss owing to substitution from \\nlife policies to RRSPs, but they did not get most of the RRSP business. On \\nthe other hand, RRSPs managed by any financial institution (or, indeed, self\\xad\\ndirected RRSPs) must be collapsed by age 71 or converted to an annuity or a \\nRRIF (registered retirement investment fund). RRIFs have proven to be less \\npopular than annuities, and since only life companies can offer annuities , \\nthey have benefited from RRSPs even when the RRSP is registered with a \\nbank, trust company or credit union. \\nWe conclude the discussion of changes in product mix and its effect on \\nasset accumulation by noting that in 1985 life compani es' annuity reserves \\nwere 76 percent of total reserv es, with life insurance reserves making up the \\nremaining 24 percent. This is a reversal of the pattern of the 1960s. In 1970, \\nannuity reserves were only 35 percent of the total; life insurance reserves \\nwere 65 percent of the total . \\nAsset Growth \\nOn balance, the changes in product mix and the overall growth rate of the in\\xad\\ndustry were unfavourable for asset growth relative to most other financial in\\xad\\nstitutions and relative to total financial assets held by all sectors of the \\neconom y. \\nTable 24 shows that life insurance companies over the 25-y ear period \\n1961-85 lost position relative to every major fmancial sector: banks , trust and \\nmortgage loan, credit unions, trusteed pension plans and even property and \\ncasualty insurance companies. According to data in Neufeld (1972:254), this \\ndecline in the relative size of life companies has been going on since at least \\nthe 194Os. From 1981 to 1985 the downward trend appears to have been \\nreversed, in part because of the slowdown in chartered banks' growth. \\nTable 25 shows the claims of the personal sector on life companies as a \\nproportion of total personal sector financial assets. These data confirm the \\nrelative decline oflife companies from 1961-81 followed by a trend reversal \\nfor 1981- 85 and continuing into 1986.

In this way the promised rate of return on, for ex\\xad\\nample, a ten-year liability can be more or less guaranteed by the acquisition \\nof a financial asset which at the time of purchase has a promised rate of return \\nover the same ten-year period. Fluctuations in market interest rates in the in\\xad\\nterim will not affect the initial yield to maturity nor the maturity value of the \\nasset, although the interim market price responds in inverse relat ionship to \\nmarket interest rates and the term inal value of reinvested interest receipts is \\nalso affected by interim fluctuations in interest rates. (In prac tice, the ap\\xad\\npropriate measures are the durations of the assets and liabilities, not simply \\nthe terms to maturity. A full technical discussion is not necessary to an un\\xad\\nderstanding of the desirability of matc hing long-term liabilities with long\\xad\\nterm assets.) \\nSince life insurance and pension liabilities are long term in nature (policies \\nare priced on the basis of long-t erm projections of interest rates), one would \\nexpect life companies to prefer long -term assets. Table 26 reveals just such a \\npattern. Short-term assets compri sing cash and deposits, Canada treasury \\nbills and short-term paper equal no more than 6.69 percent of total financial \\nassets. Long-t erm instruments in the form of bonds and mortgages and (in\\xad\\ncreasingly) stocks form the bulk of the industry 's portf olio. Not shown in \\ntable 26, which reports only financial assets, is the increased investment in \\nreal estate by the industry which rose from about $0.3 billion in 1961 to $4 \\nbillion in 1985; however, real estate assets are only about 5 percent of total \\nassets in Canada. Neave (198 1:13 5) argues that taxation revisions of 1970 \\nfavoured direct investment by life companies in real estate chiefly because \\ncapital cost allowances provided a tax shelter against now higher corporate \\ntax rates. \\nThe proportion of total financial assets held in the form of bonds fell from \\na high of 49.74 percent in 1961 to a range of about 36 to 41 percent, within \\nwhich it has fluctuated for the last 20 years . The proportion of municipal \\nbonds declined over the period. The proportion of provincial bonds has \\nremained remarkably stable since 1976.

Until \\nrecent years (when borrowing rates were tied to current market rate s), most \\nwhole life policies stipulated a maximum interest rate which could be \\ncharged on loans by life companies to policyholders . Usually, the \\npolicyholder could borrow an amount up to the cash value of the poli cy. \\nSince older policies contained a clause stipulating a low maximum interest \\nrate (6 percent on policies written prior to September 1968, for example), a \\nrise in market rates tended to make policy loans an attractive alternative to \\nbank or credit union loan s. In fact, when market rates rose sufficiently high, \\npolicy holders exploited arbitrage opportunities by borrowing and investment \\nin term deposits or other instruments offering yields higher than their bor\\xad\\nrowing costs. Figure 2 shows this close relati onship between market interest \\nrates and the flow (Le., new borrowing net of repay ments) of policy loans . \\nMortgage Assets \\nThe proportion of life company assets held as mortgages was in decline from \\n1966 to 1985, as shown in table 26. Table 27 reveals that a major decline in \\nthe importanc e of life companies in the total Canadian mortgage market rela\\xad\\ntive to other financial instit utions also began after 1966. The decline in im\\xad\\nportance of life companies in the mortgage markets can be traced in large \\npart to the 1967 Bank Act revisions and to changes in the character of NHA \\nmortgages in 1969. Prior to the 1967 Bank Act revisions, chartered banks \\nwere prevented from lending at rates in excess of 6 percent, which made \\nCentral Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) insured mortgage \\nloans (the only kind banks were then permitted to hold) unprofitable when\\xad\\never market rates exceeded this, as was often the case in the \\'60s.

There are small amounts of \\nbank loans and deposits, but almost all the remainder of the same side of the \\nbalance sheet is equity . Liabilities to policyholders are recog nized on the \\nindustry \\'s balance sheet as resulting from the time lag between receipt of \\ncash premiums and the payment of claims. Premiums are paid in advance for \\nthe most part, and claims are paid with a lag after being incurred by the in\\xad\\nsured event. \\nEquity funds are provided largely from retained earnings (as well as from \\nnew share issues and advances from parent corpor ations) , and the amount of \\nequity in turn determines the ability of fmns to take on more insurance busi\\xad\\nness.

In par\\xad\\nticular, the industry 's holdings of total mortgage assets has declined \\nprecipitou sly, in relative terms, since the 1960s when about 30 percent of all \\nmort gages in Canada were held by the industry to about 13 percent in recent \\nyears. A change in NHA mortgages from 25- to 5-year term has been the \\nchief cause of this change in the mortgage market . \\nTotal financial assets of property/ casualty companies have const ituted less \\nthan 1 percent of the total financial assets of all sectors, with no strong trend \\nover the past 25 years. \\nGovernment tax policy has had a profound effect on the demand for life \\ninsurance and on the product mix. Policies which have encouraged savings \\nthrough tax- sheltered RRSPs have increased demand for annuities both by \\nindividuals who initially register their RRSPs with a life company and by \\nthose who purchase a life annuity upon maturity of an RRSP originally \\nregistered with another financial institution. \\nTax rules permitting income averaging annuities during the 1970s caused \\na booming demand, followed by a collapse in 1981 when tax rules were \\nchanged. \\nApart from shifts in product dem and caused by tax changes, there has been \\na pronounced trend away from whole life policies and toward term insurance \\n(individual and group). This has resulted in lower amounts of funds under the \\ncontrol of life companies and has been the single most important factor ex\\xad\\nplaining the secula r decline in the relative size of insurance company assets. \\nDirect regulation of the Canadian insurance industry (both life and proper\\xad\\nty/casualty) has been aimed at protecting policyho lders by ensuring solven\\xad\\ncy. Regu lation of asset portfolios has been designed with this in mind, but in \\npractice there is little evidence that portfolio regu lation has been influential \\non the companies' decisions. \\nAccording to Hill (1986), insurance regul ation in many countries has \\naimed at redirecting financial investment and thereby the flow of real resour\\xad\\nces. Some countries, such as India, have sought to encourage local govern\\xad\\nment finance and also the housing sector.

The second section \\nbriefly surveys the relevant researc h on information asymmetries between \\nbuyers and sellers and search costs in the insurance market .

Chapter 5 has \\ntraced the relative decline in the industry which resulted from the fading \\npopularity of whole life. Many would argue that the industry was slow to in\\xad\\ntroduce new and better products. The growth of the industry during the 1970s \\nwas attributable in part to government policy on RRSPs, not to industry in\\xad\\nnovation. The industry has, for the most part, resisted the trend to term in\\xad\\nsurance and has resisted innovations in marketing. For example, the A.R. \\nWilliams agency has been successf ul in selling life insurance through a net\\xad\\nwork of part-time agents in the U.S., but it has been resisted in its efforts to \\npenetrate the Canadian market. Such a system offers the possibility of dis\\xad\\ntributional efficiencies and most economists would want the market, not \\nregulators, to decide whether it should survive . \\nWhen different life insurance premium rates for smokers and non-smokers \\nwere introduced abou t ten years ago, the industry\\'s bias again became ap\\xad\\nparen t as some fIrms complained that the innovators would skim the cream \\nof the market by attracting low risk non-s mokers and leaving the other com\\xad\\npanies with a pool of high risk individuals-an \"unfa ir\" result given that the \\nolder policies\\' premium rates were based on risks for smokers and non\\xad\\nsmokers averaged together. In any even t, most companies even tually intro\\xad\\nduced non-smokers\\' policies without harming the industry. This example \\nillustrates a more general issue. The industry has always opposed sales ef\\xad\\nforts designed to convince the consumer to drop one policy and buy another \\n(industry opposition is enshrined in \"anti-twisting\" laws which forbid this). \\nThis strikes most observers as anti-competitive and inimical to consumers\\' \\ninterests. \\nOne can understand the industry\\'s position in the light of its cost and com\\xad\\nmission structure. Commissions and other costs are usually higher than \\npremiums in the fIrst year of a policy. Agents have an incentive to sell a new \\nreplacement policy-e specially to the customer of another firm-but the \\nrums have an incentive to prevent policy lapses and switches. As a result of \\nthis incentive structure, fIrms oppose the freer competition which is in the \\nconsumer\\'s interest. \\nIf we turn away from product innovation to consideration of process in\\xad\\nnovation, which refers to the application of new and improved techniques of \\nproduction, we find few studies explaining the causes of productivity change. \\nNotable exceptions are the contributions of Globerman (1984, 1986) who \\nstudied factors determining the adoption of electronic data processing (EDP) \\nequipment in the insurance industry. In an empirical analysis of the relation\\xad\\nship between insurer size and EDP innovation, he found evidence \"that large \\ninsurers in the U.S. and Canada were, if anything, slower to comput erize \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 91}),\n",

This observation is con\\xad\\nsistent with [Globe rman\\'s] fmding that the productivity impacts of automa\\xad\\ntion decrease as one includes the largest insurers in the sample. The findings \\nsuggest caution in taking a benign attitude toward large mergers in the finan\\xad\\ncial sector\" (Globerman 1986:2 92). Some large mergers could have conse\\xad\\nquences on innovation that outweigh any potential allocative efficiency \\ngain s. \\nINFORMATION ASYM METRIES \\nIn recent years a number of economists have developed the hypothe sis of in\\xad\\nformation asymmetries in the marketpl ace. Sellers and buyers are postulated \\nto hold differ ent inform ation as regar ds, for example, the quality or charac \\xad\\nteristics of the good to be sold or purchased. These asymmetries, it is argued, \\npersist because of diff erential costs in acquiring information and are impor\\xad\\ntant because of diff erences in incentives for the two sides of the marke t. \\nWhile these concepts have excited the interest of many researchers , others \\nare doubtful of their empirical significance. \\nTwo important types of inform ation asymmetry are distinguished in in\\xad\\nsurance mar kets . Adverse selection results from information asymmetry in \\nfavour of the buyer who has information about his true risk class (e.g., his \\nstate of health or the care with which he drives) which is not available to the \\nseller. The buyer\\' s incentive is to repres ent himself as a low risk in order to \\nqualify for a low prem ium rate. Sellers are not able to costlessly ascertain the \\ntruth. The phrase adverse selection refers to the case where a seller offers a \\nsingle premium rate to a heterog eneous group and those buyers who know \\nthemselves to be risky find the offer more attractive. High risk individuals are \\nadversely selected as cust omers. Such information asymmetry favours con\\xad\\nsumers again st firms but in the extreme may prevent an insuranc e. market \\nfrom existing (see Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976 for a seminal paper) . \\nThe reverse asymmetry favours firm s against individuals who lack \\nknowledge of the price and quality characteri stics of the produc t. Mathewson \\n(1983) develops a model characterized by variation in marginal search costs \\nfor rational but not fully informed consumers. Price discrimination across \\nconsumers by frrms is possible as each individual contract sale is a negotiated \\nbilateral exchange between a consumer and life insurance agent who knows \\nhow consumers respond to price changes through information revealed by \\npotential consumers. The asymmetric information which favours the agent \\nenables him to sell essentially similar prod ucts at diff erent prices to differe nt \\nconsumers. \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 92}),\n",

They select \\ncompulsory third-party liability insurance as a homogeneous produ ct, rates \\nfor which vary by age, sex, marital status and geographic location of the \\ndriver. They argue that their empirical results support costly consumer search \\nas an explanation for price varia bility across sellers , a conclusion similar to \\nMat hewson \\'s. \\nCAPTIVE INSURA NCE COMPANIES \\nCaptive insurance companies sell insurance only to the customer or cus\\xad\\ntomers who have established them and who own them . They often operate \\noffshore for tax reas ons. The growth of captive insurance companies and off\\xad\\nshore re-insurance has been an important phenomenon in both Canada and \\nthe U.S. Since little has been written on the subject in Canada, we refer to a \\nU.S. study (Davey 1979) which focuses on taxation as the driving forc e for \\ngrowth of captives . As such, this affords an example of the significance of \\ntax considerations in the growth of domestic versu s foreign prod uction. \\nThe U.S. tax code prevents corporations from deducting contributions to \\nreserves for the purpose of self- insurance, so firms must buy insurance from \\nproperty/ casualty companies or set up a captive insurance company to serve \\nthem. By paying premiums to a captive company, the parent benefits by \\nretaining control over reserves and perhaps by reducing transactions costs. \\nHe may also benefit by reducing moral hazard (the parent has no incentive to \\nengage in behaviour which would increase the risk of the insured event, \\nwhereas he might if fully insured with an independent insurer), or he may \\nbenefit by exiting from a pool of other insurees who are on average more \\nrisky than himself (where information asymmetry prevents him from com\\xad\\nmunicating a credible signal of this fact and receiving a more favourable \\nrate) . A captive insurance company may serve one of a group of companies \\nor hospitals or government agencies and may be created to serve an unrnet \\nneed for insurance. The captive is often an offs hore compan y, little more than \\na shell, which acts as a re-ins urer for the insurance business of a traditional \\nproperty/ casualty company that \"fronts\" for the captive and handles \\npremium collections and claims adjustment in return for a share of the gross \\npremium paid by the parent corporation. Gross premiums less the fron t\\'s \\ncosts are paid entirely as re-insurance premiums to the captive who holds \\nreserves from which the claims vetted by the front are paid. \\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service soon ruled that in the case of a one-to\\xad\\none rela tionship between parent and captive, this was no more than a means \\nof bypassing regulations against deducting contributions to self -insurance \\nreserves. This ruling was followed by moves by captives to acquire third-\\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 93}),\n",

The point of recounting these events is to il\\xad\\nlustrate the significance of tax legislation on the growth of the industry \\nwhere , in this case, legislation caused growth of offshore activity. \\nCanada \\'s experience with offshore (but not captive) re-insurance com\\xad\\npanies has been tainted in some instances by allegations of fraud. Domestic \\ninsurance companies could (for a while, until the regulators clamped down \\non the use of unregistered re-insurance companies) re-insure heavily with \\noffshore companies and thereby do a large volume of business with very lit\\xad\\ntle capitalization . Some of this insurance business might be very risky . Per\\xad\\nhaps some was sold below competitive rates. The re-insurance company \\nrelied on the Canadian seller to properl y screen buyers and assign them to \\ntheir correct risk clas s. Because much of the risk was passed on to the re-in\\xad\\nsurer, the incentive to screen accurately was attenuated . Unregistered in\\xad\\nsurers also lacked full incentive to monitor the quality of this business \\nbecause they could, in the event of serious trouble , renege by claiming faul\\xad\\nty screening by the Canadian company or declare bankruptcy and remain \\noutside the reach of Canadian autho rities . \\nDIFFERENTIALS BY AGE AND SEX IN INSURAN CE RATES \\nLife insurance and annuity rates have always discriminated on the basis of \\nlife expectancy. Since it is infeasible to obtain necessary information to es\\xad\\ntimate the probability distribution of life expectancy on an individual basis, \\ndifferentiation is made on the basis of info rmation which is inexpen sive to \\nobtai n: age, sex, smoking habits and a few readily obtained indicators of in\\xad\\ndividual and ancestors \\' health status. Similarly, automobile insurance rates \\nare partly based on age, sex, marital status and geogra phical region. \\nIn recent years a movement has begun to remove premium differentials \\nbased on categorical discrimination among age and sex groups . Differential \\npension contributions or benefits based on sex have been challenged and, in \\nsome cases, removed . Differential auto insurance rates based on driver age \\nhave been challenged and, in some cases, removed (e.g. , in B.C.). \\nSome would object to categorical discrimina tion on the grounds of equi\\xad\\nty. Women currently pay more for the same benefit or receive less in benefits \\nfor the same contribution because they tend to live longer. If women are seen \\nas deserving a wealth transfer, then \"uni-sex\" rates make sense. But the equi\\xad\\nty argument is not consistent, since women would lose from \"uni-sex\" life in\\xad\\nsurance rates which are currently lower for women because of their greater \\nlongevity. Crocker and Snow (1986) argue that whatever the equity grounds \\nfor such anti-discrimination polici es, they are obtained at some cost inef\\xad\\nficiency, although they are unable to quantif y the efficiency loss.

Since women, on avera ge,live longer than men, \\nwomen 's pension benefits exceed men's. If women 's contributions are \\nequalized with men's, the employer must pay the differ ence. The employer \\nwill then either avoid hiring women or seek to recover the higher pension \\ncosts by paying lower wages to women. \\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS \\nThe life insurance industry has been reactive rather than innovative in \\ndesigning and promoting new products. This conservative stance has con\\xad\\ntributed to the decline of the industry relative to other financial institutions\\xad\\nat least as measured by assets. However, as measured by contribution to GDP \\nin constant dollars, the industry has grown at above average rates (see chap\\xad\\nter 2). The pace of product innovation appears to have increased since the lat\\xad\\nter part of the last decade, and the industry 's prospects for the future appear \\nto be strong on this score. \\nWhile direct evidence on particular process innovations is scarce, the \\noverall evidence of prod uctivity growth (shown in chapter 4) reflects very \\nfavourably on the life insuran ce industry but less favourably on the proper\\xad\\nty/liability insurance industry. Glober man's studies of the introduction of \\ncomputers in the insurance industry found some evidence that larger frrms \\nwere less innovative than smaller frrms . \\nThe growth of captive insurance companies and offshore re-insurance has \\nbeen one of the most important innovations in the structure of the proper\\xad\\nty/casualty insurance industry in recent years in both Canada and the U.S. To \\na large extent, this growth appears to have been driven by tax consider ations, \\nat least in the U.S. \\nThe theories of information asymmetry (as between buyers and sellers) \\nand of the costly acquisition of information have been applied to the in\\xad\\nsuran ce industry. These theories are enlisted to explain price dispersion and \\nprice discrimination in insurance markets. However, one could as well ex\\xad\\nplain price dispersion in term s of as yet unmeasured variations acro ss sellers \\nin product quality and product character istics, and we must conclude that \\nthere is not yet a generally agreed explanation of pric e disper sion. \\nIn recent years there has been a movement to remove differentials in auto \\ninsurance premiums based on age and sex and to remove differentials in pen\\xad\\nsion (annuity) contributions based on sex. This movement has been based on \\na search for equity but it is likely to have unintended effects in terms of both \\nequity and efficiency. For example, uni-sex pension plans may raise \\nemp1oye rs' costs of female labour, resulting in reduced wages or reduced \\nemployment for women. \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 95}),\n",

It is also concerned with the equitable treatment of producers and \\nconsume rs in the mar ketplace. The government employs a number of instru\\xad\\nments to control the insurance industry, the most significant policy levers \\nbeing regulation and competition and tax policies. \\nIn order to formulate appropriate policies, government needs information \\non growth, employment, produ ctivity and prices in insuranc e services, as \\nwell as information on the effects of regulation and taxation policy and the \\ninadvertent impacts of policies in areas other than insurance. In this chapter \\neach of these topics is discussed, pulling together the relevant evidence \\ndeveloped in other chapte rs. We recognize that in many areas of concern to \\npolicy makers there is insuffic ient evidence to support a consensus among \\neconom ists. However, policy decisions cannot be delayed in the face of con\\xad\\nstant cries for more resear ch. In this chapter, we suppress scholarly caution \\nand draw conclusions as best we can. \\nPRODUCTION AND DEMAND \\nOver the period 1961 -85, the insura nce industry (life and property/ casualty \\ncombined) has grown in real terms at the same rate as all industries com\\xad\\nbined--4.4 percent per year compounded- which is considerably faster than \\nmanufacturing at 4.1 percent per year but slower than total services at 4.7 \\npercent. The two insurance industry components have grown at widely dis\\xad\\nparate rates- 2.8 percent annual growth for property/ casualty but 5.8 percent \\nfor life insurance. \\nThe analysis of the effects of income growth on consumers in chapter 3 \\nhelps explain the growth of insurance services.

              " Document(page_content=\"80 Industrial Develo pment, Policy Issues, Conclusions \\nwe estimated an income elasticity of demand for insurance services (life and \\nproperty/ casualty combined) of about 1.5. For non-in surance services the es\\xad\\ntimated income elasticity is about 1.25; for non- durables and semi-durables \\nit is less than 1.0. These results imply a secular trend which is higher than the \\ngrowth rate of income, assuming relative prices are constant. Our anal ysis \\nalso reveals a high price elasticity of demand for insurance serv ices, which \\nimplies a strong negative impact on demand and on industry sales revenue \\nfrom price incre ases. Property/ casualty insurance prices grew faster than the \\ntotal consumer price index (CPI) during 1971 to 1985, but the price oflife in\\xad\\nsurance serv ices, by our measure, grew at a slower rate. This difference in \\nprice perf ormance helps to explain the dif ference in growth of demand. \\nThe prices of goods other than insurance also influence insurance demand. \\nWhen the prices of other goods rise, demand for insurance rises . The effect \\nis particularly strong for dura ble goods. As their prices rise, more insurance \\nis demanded to cover their increased valu e. \\nIn addition to income and price effects, consumer demand is significantly \\ninfluenced by other (demogra phic) characteri stics of households. Demand \\nfor property insurance rises with age of household head but falls for life in\\xad\\nsura nce. The aging of Canada 's population has obvious implications for fu\\xad\\nture demand when combined with this result. The reverse pattern holds for \\nsize of household: demand falls with size of household for property in\\xad\\nsurance but rises for life insurance. If the decline in average household size \\nin Canada contin ues, it has implications for future demand. We fmd that \\nfemale household heads spend more on property insurance and less on life \\ninsurance than otherwise similarly situated male househoid heads. Tenant \\nhouseholds spend much less on property insu rance than do homeowners . \\nDemand for both types of insurance is significantly higher in Quebec than in \\nother provin ces. \\nEMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY \\nInsurance industry employment constituted about 1 percent of total employ\\xad\\nment in 1985 and has grown at about 1.3 percent per year over 1961-85, \\nslower than total employment. The positive effec t on emplo yment of the \\nrapid growth of life insurance output was partly offset by the rapid growth of \\nprodu ctivity in this industry component. \\nThe quality of insurance jobs, as evidenced by average weekly earnings, \\nis higher than in all industries combined and higher than in other finance, in\\xad\\nsurance and real estate industries.

The \\nshift in employment and production in favour of services appears to fore tell \\na slowdown in productivity perf ormance in the economy and a consequent \\nslowdown in the rate of improve ment in living standard s. By and large, the \\noffic ial statistic s support the opinion that productivity improvement is slower \\nin services. \\nThe story told by the official statistics is probably biased. The quality and \\nvalidity of the output measures for service industries are inferior to those for \\nmanuf acturing industries . For some service industries, output is proxied by \\nlabour input, resulting in zero labour produc tivity growth by def mition. \\nSome would argue that this is the result of the difficulty of def ming and \\nmeasuring service output, but we would argue it is the result of decades of \\nrelative neglect Researc h and development of service output measures has \\nbeen underfunded as has basic survey work. In support of our view we offer \\nour reSults for the life insurance industry which show labour productivity \\ngrowth of3.95 percent per year during 1961-85, which compares to 3.08 per\\xad\\ncent in manufacturing for the same period. \\nOur analysis in chapter 4 also contains estimates of total factor produc\\xad\\ntivity for life and property/c asualty combined , reveal ing a respectable \\ngrowth of about 1 percent per year compounded over 1977 to 1984. \\nFOREIGN TRADE \\nThe bulk of insurance exports are earned on insured exported merchandise \\nand vice versa for imports. Thus, trade in merchandise drives trade in ser\\xad\\nvices. Both exports and imports are in the range of 5 to 7 percent of the total \\nvalue of insurance services produced in Canada, with exports equal to about \\n80 to 90 percent of imports . The re-insurance market is international in \\nscope, and companies in Canada (especially property/ casualty companies) \\npurchase significant amounts of re-insurance services abroad. \\nCanadian life companies, in their global operati ons, earned about $5.6 bil\\xad\\nlion or 40 percent of their premium income abroad in 1985, but this interna\\xad\\ntional success is little reflected in the balance of payments figures because \\nthese premiums are earned by foreign subsidiaries of Canadian companies \\nand as such are treated as transactions between non-resident corporations and \\nnon-resident institutions, .not as cross-border transactio ns. Only the net \\nrevenues of Canadian insurance companies from oper ations abroad are \\nrecorded in the balance of paym ents. \\nCanada, along with most foreign countries, requires that domestic assets \\nbe held by all companies against domestic liabilities.

This has been achieved as evidenced by the fact that \\nCanadian life insurance firms have been highly successful in their foreign \\noperation s. In 1985, over 40 percent of Canadian federally registered \\ncompanie s' global business was outside Canada. \\nCOMPETITION POLICY AND MERGERS \\nThe degree of competition and the incentive to merge in the insurance in\\xad\\ndustry is determined in part by the extent to which economies of scale \\n(specialization) and economies of scope (diversity) exist. A production \\nproce ss is said to display economies of scale if cost increa ses by less than a \\ngiven proportional increase in all outputs produced. Diseconomies of scale \\nrefer to the converse case. \\nThe question of economies of scale is relevant to the issue of horizontal \\nmerger policy. Mergers in the presence of economies of scale can reduce unit \\ncosts of production and thereby increase efficiency within the industry. On \\nthe other hand, mergers within an industry when scale economies do not exist \\n. may just lead to increased monopolization and the inefficiency which results \\nfrom price in excess of marginal cost. The evidence on economies of scale in \\nthe life insurance industry as cited in chapter 4 is neutral , for the most part. \\nEconomies of scale are not large for firms producing 5 perc ent, or even less , \\nof industry output and neither is there strong evidence of diseconomies of \\nscale for the largest firms. Mergers will neither significantly reduce competi\\xad\\ntion nor improve the efficiency with which industry output is produced. \\nThe data on industry concentration reported in table 30 provide little cause \\nfor concern. The percentage of the market controlled by the four largest \\nproperty !casualty fmns has risen over the 1961-85 period but remains very \\nlow at 9.2 percent in 1961 and 18.1 percent in 1985. On the other hand, the \\ncontrol by the four largest life companies is much greater at over 40 perc ent; \\nbut the trend is down. \\nA policy of easy entry for both Canadian and foreign companies has \\nhelped to prevent undue conce ntration, and such policies should be con\\xad\\ntinued. \\nThe concept of economies of scope is an important extension to the older \\nconcept of economies of scale. This new concept recognizes the multi\\xad\\nproduct nature of most firms. In life insurance, economies of scope may \\nresult from the cost savings associated with the sales efforts of an agent who \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 99}),\n",

The existence of economies of scope plays an impor\\xad\\ntant role in the detennination of the efficiency consequences of conglomerate \\nmerge rs. These mergers are relevant to entry deregulation of the four pillars: \\ninsurance, banks, security deale rs, and trust compa nies. Eliminating barri ers \\nto entry would pennit the sort of \"one- stop fmancial shopping\" pioneered by \\nSears, American Express and others in the U.S. The existence of significant \\neconomies of scope is the key to the efficiency gains of such produc tion. Yet \\nevidence is scarce or non-existent. As stated in chapter 4, there is only one \\nstudy on economies of scope in the insurance industry that we know of, and \\nthe results are for life insurance products only. It was found that economies \\nof scope are rather weak. No one has investigated for economies of scope \\namong life insurance and property/ liability insurance products. \\nREGULATION \\nFederal regulation of the life insurance industry has historically been pruden\\xad\\ntial, aimed at ensuring the financial health of the industry and safety for \\npolicyholders by requiring that policy reserves meet certain standards and \\nthat investments be conservative and low risk. A mortgage cannot be issued \\nfor more than 75 percent of a proper ty\\'� value. A limited fraction (now 25 \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

Life companies are required to hold Canadian assets in proportion \\nto their Canadian business. \\nFederal regulations require property and casualty companies to maintain \\nassets (valued at market prices) in excess of liabilities by a margin of at least \\n15 perc ent. \\nEntry has been relatively free into both industries but each life company \\nhas, until 1987, been limited in the maximum percentage it can hold of the \\ncommon stock of any one company (30 percent, with some exceptions such \\nas realty companie s). Deregulation of fmancial market s, beginning in 1987, \\nremoves most ownership barri ers. The precise details of new legislation were \\nstill the subject of debate at the time this study was written, which fact limits \\nour ability to comment on the effects of deregu lation; \\nIn addition to regulating the affairs of provincially licensed companies, the \\nprovinces regulate the licensing of agents . The restriction of sales channels \\nfor life insurance, in particular, is an important issue. Many would argue that \\ninefficient distribution is a prime policy concern. Deregulation offered the \\nopportunity to improve insurance retailing by, for example, pennitting life \\ncompanie s to sell through subsidiary trust compan ies, which they are al\\xad\\nlowed to own as of 1987. This particular retailing possibility is now in doubt \\nas it has been actively opp osed by life insurance agents who feel that the \\npublic requires service from an expert and specialized sales staff. \\nOnly fInns licensed by the federal or provincial governments to sell life \\ninsurance in Canada may do so. This restriction could have proven to be \\nhighly protec tionist but for the fact that Canadian regulations have always \\npennitted foreign firms to become licensed and to operate in Canada. This \\ncontrasts with the heavy restrictions placed on foreign banks in Canada prior \\nto the 1980 Bank Act revisions. \\nTAXATION \\nIn chapter 5 we analysed the impac t of tax-sh eltered individual savings \\nvehicles (RRSPs) on the growth of the life insurance industry. We also note \\nhere that the industry shares in the growth of another tax-she ltered savings \\nvehicle, namely trusteed pension plans for groups of emplo yees, with life \\ncompanies controlling a minority share of the assets . \\nSince 1969, life companies have been taxed on both their business profits \\nand their investment income. The industry is particularly sensitive to taxation \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 101}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\"Industrial Devel opment, Policy Issues, Conclusions 85 \\nof investment income as such taxes fall more heavily on whole life rather \\nthan term insurance, thereby inhibiting the growth of their most profitable \\nprod uct. Whole life has a savings component, unlike pure (term) insurance, \\nand the associated reserves and investment income are larger for whole life. \\nWe have argued at several points in this study that the prep ayment of \\nproperty and casualty insurance prem iums and the lag �n payment of claims \\nresults in an interes t free loan by policyholders to companies . Companies use \\nthese loans to acquire interest earning assets, and they pay taxes on the result\\xad\\ning investment income. We have also argued that competition forces \\npremium rates to reflect the interest opportunity cost on these loan s. Thus, \\nconsumers pay lower premiums than they would if explicit cash interest were \\npaid on these loans. As things now stand, consumers barter the use of money \\nfor reduced premiums and, as with other barter transac tions , the Canadian \\nSystem of Natio nal Accounts should reflect this via imputed interest income \\nand an equal imputed increase in consumer expenditure on premiums. For in\\xad\\nsurance purchased by the business sector as intermediate inputs , the in\\xad\\ncreased imputed interest income exactly balances the increased imputed \\npremium expense and there is no net increase in GDP. For insurance pur\\xad\\nchased by the personal sector, investment income and personal expenditure \\nrise equally and therefore so does GDP. \\nThe point in repeating this analysis here is that our argument would appear \\nto justify taxation of imputed intere st income to individ uals. Since imputed \\nintere st is not currently taxed in the hands of individ uals, the industry \\nbenefits. Business sector (purchaser) imputed income is offs et by business \\nSector imputed expense, so taxable profits would be unchanged. Sim ilarly, \\nproperty/ casualty compan ies' imputed revenue and expense would be equal \\nwith no change in their taxable income. The federal government in 1986/87 \\nhas, in fact, con sidered related questions of taxation of imputed interest on \\ndeposits. \\nSome of the most signifi cant effec ts of gove rnment policy on the industry \\nhave been inadvertent results of changes in tax legislation and in government \\nprogr ammes which were designed with other goals in mind. The effects on \\nthe insurance industry were major but incidental to the original purpose. For \\nexample, the major purpose of introducing individual tax-shel tered savings \\nplans (RR SPs) was to assist individuals in providing for their retirement \\nyears. But as shown in chapter 5, RRSPs had a major impact on the growth \\nof the life insurance industry. Other examples-the enhancement of death, \\ndisability, dependent 'survivor and retirement benefits under the Canada and \\nQuebec Pension Plans-have had an effect on the demand for privately sup-\\nI . plied substitutes for these prod ucts. \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 102}),\n",

In the U.K., inflation indexed bonds have been \\navailable to retired individuals (\"granny bond s\"). There is clearly a dem and \\nin Canada for such instruments as seen by the demand for indexed pensions. \\nInternational experience has shown that, with few exception s, only govern\\xad\\nments offer such instrume nts. These bonds, if issued by the Canadian govern\\xad\\nment, could be bought by private sector financial intennediar ies, including \\nlife companie s, as backing for RRSPs, resulting in increased demand for an\\xad\\nnuities. \\nCONCLUSIO NS \\nTwo sets of factors are driving insurance industry output and employment \\ngrowth . First, a high respo nsiveness of consumer demand and industry \\nrevenue to income growth and to pric e changes has favoured the life in\\xad\\nsura nce industry. The price of life insurance serv ices has risen by less than \\nthe inflation rate, while the reverse holds true for property/ casualty. The in\\xad\\nfluences of low income elasticity and high price inflation hamper the growth \\nof the property /casualty industry. Secondly, industry growth , espec ially for \\nlife insurance, is strongly buffeted up and down by tax policy (RR SPs have \\nhad partic ular impact). \\nIndustry productivity perf onnance (especially for life insurance and less \\nso for property/ casualty) has been healthy. The speed of prod uct innovation \\nhas been improving in the last decade and will receive fresh impetus from \\nderegulation . \\nGovernment regulation has focused on ensuring prudential management \\nof assets to guard against default to policyholders . The life insurance industry \\nin particular has an enviable record in this regard, but it is unlikely that \\ngovernment regulation is the major cause of this success. The industry itself \\nis very conscious of the necessity for preserving a good reputati on. \\nThe competitive health of the industry is evidenced by low concentration \\nratio s, easy entry and lack of evidence of significant returns to scale. For the \\nmost part, merger policy can be contented with benign neglect. \\nTax policy has powe rful effects on the industry and these effects are some\\xad\\ntimes unforeseen, requiring care in the fonnulation of tax initiatives . \\nDeregulation will soon have significant and largely unforeseeable effects \\non the industry, but one opportunity for efficiency improvement may already \\nbe.sli pping away. Distribution channels for life insurance are likely to remain \\nmonopolized by life companies instead of being made more competitive by \\nwww.fraserinstitute.org', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/GeekRabbit/insurance-industry-in-canada.pdf', 'page': 103}),\n",

It may be true, as the \\ninsurance industry argues , that policyholders are best served by spec ialized \\nagents, but it would be better to let the market decide how specialized these \\nagents must be and not leave the decision to regulatory edict. \\nThe analysis of the insurance industry, like all service industries , is in its \\ninfancy. Numerous important issues have been highlighted in this study \\nwhich bear on effective policy formulation and for which there is little or no \\nempirical evidence. First, the issue of economies of product diversity or \\nscope has to be investigated for both life and property/ casualty insuranc e. \\nPolicies regar ding the efficiency gains and losses of conglomerate mergers \\nand deregulating financial services can only be answe red with a knowledge \\nof the extent of scope economies . \\nSecondly, changes in the regulatory and tax environments facing in\\xad\\nsurance companies will cause these fIrms to change the quantity and variety \\nof their products and to alter their pricing strateg y. Policymakers need to \\nknow how insurance fIrms will adjust. Coupled with this adjustment, there \\nwill be changes in employment and produ ctivity brought about by any new \\npolicies. \\nThe third issue pertains to the demand for insurance servic es. There is no \\nevide nce, apart from the analysis in chapter 3, on the dete rminants of demand \\nfor various types of insurance services, and on the character istics of the con\\xad\\nsumers who contribute to determ ining demand for these serv ices .
